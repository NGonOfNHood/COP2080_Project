# COP2080_Project - SPIDAM

# Description
This project is to design, analyze, and model sound in places such as hallways. The goal is to measure the sound by using numerical values and graphs.

- **How to Start**:
  - Import the main.py, requirements.txt, and the README.md file over into pycharm. You can do this by dragging the three files into the project directory
  - Install all the requirements in requirements.txt. If you stumble onto an error, change your intepreter to python 3.11 as this does not work with 3.13
  - Now follow the basic instructions

- **Basic Instructions**:
  - Run the main.py file
  - Import an audio file, any audio file (wav, mp3, or aac)
  - Click through buttons to choose graphs

- **Sound Conversion**:
  - Convert all files into .wav if not already
  - Remove any data tags, if any
  - Handle multi-channel audio by converting it to a single channel

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Calculate RT60 values for low, mid, and high frequency ranges
  - Generate statistics
  - Visualize data plots

- **Reporting**:
  - Identify trends and patterns in RT60
  - Highlight frequency ranges with the longest reverberation times
