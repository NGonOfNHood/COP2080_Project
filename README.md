# COP2080_Project - SPIDAM

# Description
This project is to design, analyze, and model sound in places such as hallways. The goal is to measure athe sound by using numerical values and graphs.

## Basic Instructions
- **File Handling**:
  - Import audio files any audio file (wav, mp3, or aac).
  - Convert all files into wav if not already
  - Remove any data tags, if any.
  - Handle multi-channel audio by converting it to a single channel.

*In Progress Below

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Calculate RT60 values for low, mid, and high frequency ranges.
  - Generate summary statistics (e.g., sample length, peak frequencies).
  - Visualize data with six types of plots, including waveforms and frequency-based RT60.

- **Reporting**:
  - Identify trends and patterns in RT60.
  - Highlight frequency ranges with the longest reverberation times.
  - Suggest acoustic treatments for optimization.
