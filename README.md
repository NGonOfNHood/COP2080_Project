# COP2080_Project - SPIDAM

# Description
This project is to design, analyze, and model sound in places such as hallways. The goal is to measure the sound by using numerical values and graphs.

- **Basic Instructions**:
  - Import audio files any audio file (wav, mp3, or aac).
  - Convert all files into .wav if not already.
  - Remove any data tags, if any.
  - Handle multi-channel audio by converting it to a single channel.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Calculate RT60 values for low, mid, and high frequency ranges.
  - Generate statistics
  - Visualize data plots.

- **Reporting**:
  - Identify trends and patterns in RT60.
  - Highlight frequency ranges with the longest reverberation times.
